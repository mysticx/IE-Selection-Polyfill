IE-Selection-Polyfill
=====================

IE polyfill for the W3C Selection/Range API, intended for IE8 or lower. The internet explorer selection object API used in IE 8 and below.

The IE 8 windows selection API: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/ms535869%28v=vs.85%29.aspx

With this API I implement the window.getSelection method, which returns W3C Selection object. This Selection object is intended to have the same methods, properties and functionality, according to the W3C Selection specifications.
